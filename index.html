						<p>Hi, I'm Yutong Yuan, a graduate student studying data journalism at University of Missouri.
							I love finding stories in data and telling them through graphics.
							I'm a true believer of the magic of data viz and a constant learner of digital tools.
						</p>
						<p>A journaism major at college, I explored radio broadcasting, video shooting, and reporting through courses, school newspaper and radio station.
							My first internship as a business reporter after collge led me to the world of data.
							It also inspired me to study at Mizzou and to pursue my career as a data journalist.
						</p>
						<p>
							At Mizzou, I'm learning by doing.
							The experience of working with the Missourian, a local newspaper with a history of 110 years, as a reporter and a graphic designer let me understand
							how to tell stories and how to work under the pressure of deadlines.
							At the same time I get the chance to hone my the skills of data-cleaning, data-analysis and data visualization in a real setting.
